Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at Queenâ€™s University, and am on the Job Market this year. My research interests are in Industrial Organization and Quantitative Marketing. My current research focuses on modelling consumer decisions in online markets through structural search models and reduced-form prediction models, with applications to clickstream data.
