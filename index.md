Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at Queenâ€™s University. My research interests are in Industrial Organization and Quantitative Marketing. My current research focuses on modelling consumer decisions in online markets through structural search models and reduced-form prediction models, with applications to clickstream data.  

I am on the 2024-2025 job market and will be available for interviews.
