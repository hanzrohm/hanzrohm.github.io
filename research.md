## Retailer Differentiation, Learning, and Consumer Search: Application to Online Search for Cameras  
*Job Market Paper*  
Abstract: This paper develops a model of consumer search with retailer differentiation in information provision. Consumers shopping for infrequently purchased durable products that are available at multiple retailers face uncertainty over prices and match values. Their decision over which retailer to search at depends on both the distribution of prices and the product information available, interpreted as match information. Through the lens of a search model with learning, retailers providing better match information provide more precise signals of match values. Consumers may direct search to retailers that provide reliable match information so that much of the consumer's uncertainty can be resolved. Thus, retailers may attract consumers either by offering low prices or providing more reliable match information. Using the model, I estimate counterfactuals to (a) quantify the benefit to consumers of platform competition, and (b) study a retailer's ability to divert consumer search.

## [Using Search Data to Crowd-source Unobserved Substitution Patterns for Demand Prediction](/docs/subs_dem_pred.pdf)
Abstract: Many demand models rely on the characteristics-space approach to represent products and estimate consumer preferences. A practical limitation with the approach in some markets is that if demand-relevant characteristics are not observed, the substitution patterns the model predicts are unreliable. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method of learning substitution patterns directly from search data. The approach is to treat the sets of products that consumers search for as their revealed consideration set, and measure product substitution between a pair of product by their frequency of co-searches across \text{all} consumers' search sets. This substitution measure can then be mapped to vectors of latent characteristics representing each product. I validate the latent characteristics by using them as an input to a simple predictive demand model applied to data on online shopping at a large UK eCommerce platform. The aim is to predict which product a consumer will purchase given the set of previously searched products, as in a recommender system. I find that representing products with latent characteristics leads to improvement in prediction performance. These findings are supported by replicating the empirical analysis within a Monte Carlo simulation of consumer search.
